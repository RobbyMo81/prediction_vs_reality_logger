# ðŸ§ª Testing Phase Approach & Checklist

## Phase 1: Test Environment Setup
- [ ] Ensure all dependencies are installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- [ ] Install the package in editable mode (`pip install -e .`)
- [ ] Verify all environment variables and config files are present
- [ ] Confirm test data (sample forecasts, configs) are available

---

## Phase 2: Test Suite Sanity Check
- [ ] Run all tests (`pytest`)
- [ ] Check for import/module errors
- [ ] Identify and document any syntax errors in test or source files
- [ ] Ensure all test files are valid Python modules (no one-line or malformed files)

---

## Phase 3: Unit Test Coverage
- [ ] Add/verify tests for all new modules (tensor, translator, notifications, CLI)
- [ ] Run coverage report (`pytest --cov=prediction_logger --cov-report=term-missing`)
- [ ] Identify modules/functions with <90% coverage
- [ ] Add tests for uncovered code paths (branches, error handling, edge cases)

---

## Phase 4: Functional & Integration Testing
- [ ] Test CLI end-to-end (simulate user commands, dry-run, error cases)
- [ ] Test notification logic (mock Slack/webhook/email, simulate failures)
- [ ] Test tensor and LLM integration (mock external APIs, check error handling)
- [ ] Validate config/environment override logic

---

## Phase 5: Non-Functional Testing
- [ ] Add performance tests (forecast eval < 1s, tensor/LLM < 5s)
- [ ] Add security checks (no hardcoded secrets, env var validation)
- [ ] Plan and test for multi-symbol and scaling support

---

## Phase 6: Issue Tracking & Reporting
- [ ] Document all test failures with:
  - Test name
  - Error message/traceback
  - Suspected root cause (import error, missing dependency, logic bug, etc.)
- [ ] Categorize issues:
  - Environment/setup
  - Syntax/import/module errors
  - Logic/functional bugs
  - Coverage gaps
- [ ] Assign owners for each issue and track resolution

---

## Phase 7: Handoff Preparation
- [ ] Prepare a summary report of:
  - Test coverage %
  - Outstanding issues and blockers
  - Steps to reproduce failures
  - Recommendations for next steps
- [ ] Ensure all test scripts, configs, and instructions are up to date in the repo

---

## ðŸ”Ž Where Issues Are Appearing & Why

- **Import/Module Errors:** Usually due to missing editable install or incorrect PYTHONPATH.
- **Syntax Errors:** Malformed test files (often from copy-paste or one-line code).
- **Missing Dependencies:** Not all required packages installed (e.g., torch, openai).
- **Logic/Test Failures:** Uncovered code paths, unhandled exceptions, or incorrect mocks.
- **Coverage Gaps:** New modules or error branches not tested.

---

**Tip:** Run `pytest -v` and `pytest --cov` after each phase to quickly spot and localize issues.
